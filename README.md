# Mastermind
A digital version of the board game Mastermind. Creates a GUI that allows the user to play Mastermind. The game is played by clicking on the pegs to add them in any color pattern. The user's guess will be logged line by line until the correct guess is chosen or until the user runs out of lines to guess. The solution area is hidden until the game ends. 4 small pegs are generated after each guess that tell the user if any of the pegs they guessed are the correct color, but not in the right spot, or if they are the correct color in the correct spot.
